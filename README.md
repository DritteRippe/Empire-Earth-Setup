## Notes for Modders
Empire Earth is very sensitive to version change (which leads to multiplayer incompatibility), some modders might be interested in using this setup to deliver their mods. Please do not do this unless you have created a really popular and functional modpack. We must avoid creating multiple versions of the game to avoid fracturing the community.

## Notes for Dev 
Since the script is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 you have every right to modify the setup script to generate your own versions, but you must also publish the source code of the script. So if you want to contribute I invite you to fork this project, if you have ideas of modifications to do don't hesitate to make suggestions, I also invite you to make pull requests if you think you have done something that deserves to be in this script. The version of the script I'm distributing should become the standard to facilitate future installations. I hope you understand the objective and how necessary and helpful it is for everyone. If you think something is wrong, don't hesitate to tell me!

## Building

### Requirements
- Windows (or Wine) with [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) **6.2.x**. Releases are built with 6.2.2; newer versions are untested.
- The game data and setup media. They are not part of this repository (see [Assets](#assets)).
- The AppId GUIDs of both setups (see [AppIds](#appids)).
- Python 3, only for placeholder builds (`ci/make_placeholder_assets.py`).

### Assets
The script packs files from these folders, which are listed in `.gitignore`:

| Folder | Content |
|---|---|
| `data\` | Game files (EE, AoC, NeoEE), add-ons (DLLs, DirectX wrappers, maps, civilizations, HD content, tools) and [localized-text](https://github.com/EE-modders/localized-text) |
| `internal\media\` | Wizard images and setup backgrounds |
| `internal\misc\` | Setup music (`Loop.flac`) and, for signed builds, the certificate |
| `internal\runtime\` | DirectX End-User Runtime web installer |

The exact file list of a variant: dump its preprocessed script (`ci\build.ps1 -KeepPreprocessed <dir>`) and run `python ci\make_placeholder_assets.py --list <dir>\EE_Regular.iss`.

### AppIds
`EE_AppID` and `NeoEE_AppID` are empty in this repository, and the build stops with an error until both are provided (GUIDs without braces, different from each other). The AppId identifies the setup for Windows (uninstall entry, updates in place), so official builds must keep the AppIds of the published setups, and forks must generate their own once (Inno Setup IDE: *Tools > Generate GUID*) and never change them.

### Build switches
Every switch has a default in the settings block of `setup_is6.iss` and can be overridden with `ISCC /D<Switch>=<Value>`, so building a variant never requires editing the script:

| Switch | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `InstallType` | `EE`, `NeoEE` | `EE` |
| `InstallMode` | `Regular`, `Portable` | `Regular` |
| `EE_AppID`, `NeoEE_AppID` | AppId GUIDs without braces | empty (required) |
| `SignSetup` | `0`, `1` | `0` |
| `CertFileName`, `CertHashSHA1` | certificate in `internal\misc` and its SHA1 (signed builds only) | `cert_name.crt`, empty |
| `TestID` | `0` = release, `> 0` = test build (fast compression, warning on start) | `0` |

```bat
ISCC /DInstallType=NeoEE /DInstallMode=Portable /DEE_AppID=<GUID> /DNeoEE_AppID=<GUID> setup_is6.iss
```

Signed builds (`/DSignSetup=1`) also need the sign tools named in `[Setup]` (`NameInInnoSetupEE`, `NameInInnoSetupNeo`), e.g. `ISCC "/SNameInInnoSetupEE=signtool.exe sign /a $f" ...`.

### Build script
`ci\build.ps1` builds all four variants (EE/NeoEE x Regular/Portable) into `out\<Type>_<Mode>\` and checks that every output file matches its variant:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ci\build.ps1 -EEAppID <GUID> -NeoEEAppID <GUID>
```

Useful options: `-Variants NeoEE/Regular`, `-OutputDir <dir>`, `-Iscc <path to ISCC.exe>`, `-KeepPreprocessed <dir>`. Run `Get-Help ci\build.ps1 -Detailed` for all of them.

### Contributing without the game data
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ci\build.ps1 -Placeholders
```
creates a small placeholder file for every missing asset (existing files are never overwritten) and uses dummy AppIds. Such a build only proves that the script compiles for all variants: **never distribute it**, and remove the placeholder files before building with the real data.

### Continuous integration
`.github/workflows/build.yml` runs the placeholder build with Inno Setup 6.2.2 on `windows-latest` for every push and pull request and uploads the preprocessed script of every variant as an artifact.

### Conventions
The own `.iss` files are UTF-8 **with BOM** and CRLF (see `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes`): Inno Setup 6.2 reads files without BOM as ANSI and would break non-ASCII text. Release notes go into [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## License
Consider setup_is6.iss, utils.iss, pages.iss, messages.iss, extention.iss under **GPL-3.0 License**.
